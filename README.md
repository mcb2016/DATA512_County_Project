# DATA512_County_Project

## Project Goal

This extension of A4 serves to address three primary questions:

1) How did the covid pandemic affect St. Louis economy at the county level? 
2) Which demographics in St. Louis County were more susceptible to contracting severe cases of covid? 
3) Were there surrounding, more rural counties that were affected in a similar manner to St. Louis County?
